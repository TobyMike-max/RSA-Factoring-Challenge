# RSA Factoring Challenge

## 0. Factorize all the things
Factorize as many numbers as possible into a product of two smaller numbers.

- Usage: factors <file>
* Twhere <file> is a file containing natural numbers to factor.
* One number per line
* You can assume that all lines will be valid natural numbers greater tan 1
* You can assume tat there will be no empty line, and no space before and after the valid number
* The file will always end with a new line

- Output format: n=pq
* One factorization per line
* p and q don't have to be prime numbers.
* Program runs without any dependencies
